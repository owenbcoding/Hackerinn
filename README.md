## HackerInn

**A focused home base for builders to show up, do real work, and track their progress without distractions.**

### What this project is

HackerInn is a simple web app designed for developers, indie hackers, and small teams who want a calm, intentional place to work.  
Instead of trying to do everything, it focuses on a few core ideas:

- **Check in daily** with what you plan to work on.
- **Run focused work sessions** and log what you actually shipped.
- **Track your streaks and progress** over time so you can see the work you are putting in.
- **Keep a lightweight changelog** of what you built, learned, and what is coming next.

No timelines, feeds, or noisy dashboards—just a clear space to build and keep yourself accountable.

### Who it is for

- **Indie hackers & solo devs** who want a structured way to work on side projects.  
- **Small teams and hackathon groups** that want quick check-ins without heavy process.  
- **Anyone who values deep work** and wants visibility into their own progress.

### How to think about it

You can think of HackerInn as:

- A **daily check-in ritual** instead of a to-do list that never ends.  
- A **personal build log** instead of a social network.  
- A **simple accountability tool** to help you keep showing up and shipping.

The technical stack behind the scenes (Laravel, Vue, Inertia, Tailwind, etc.) is there to support this idea, but the goal of the project is easy to understand even for non-technical people:  
**give builders a quiet, focused place on the internet where they can consistently do the work that matters.**
